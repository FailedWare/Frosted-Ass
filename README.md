# Frosted-Ass
Modified version of Frosted Glass, meant to be used for Powercord clients but it can work with BetterDiscord I think.

### Powercord Installation

***Windows/Linux*** if this doesnt work with linux please yell at me. I dont know if ***MacOS*** can follow this.
- Open your Terminal
- Type in ``cd powercord/src/Powercord/themes && git clone https://github.com/FailedWare/Frosted-Ass/``
- Refresh your discord after its downloaded (Shift+R) (before you refresh disable all other themes to prevent breaking Powercord)
- Theme should be installed

### BetterDiscord Installation

***Windows/Linux/MacOS***
- Drag ***Theme.css*** out of the ***Frosted-Ass*** folder (Don't include ***powercord_manifest.json*** it should only be included if your using a Powercord client)
- Drag ***Theme.css*** into ***BetterDiscords*** themes folder.
- Theme should be installed (Refresh if you dont see it)

***Unconfirmed if Frosted-Ass can work with other modded discord clients***
